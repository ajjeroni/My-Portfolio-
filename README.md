# My Portfolio

## Description

In this project, students were given the task to build a portofolio website from scratch. To successfully complete this task students needed to have basic elements in their website like headings, sections, images, navigation, and user interface. 

Starting this project was simple, as HTML doesn't require much thought process. But when it came to CSS it became very difficult, especially with UI and responsiveness when adapting to different viewports. Overall, I would say I did the very basic in completing this project. I am eager, however, to continue learning and improving my Portfolio overtime as I become more advanced in HTML, CSS, and even JavaScript.
